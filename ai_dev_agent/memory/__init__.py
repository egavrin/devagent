"""Memory system for DevAgent - ReasoningBank pattern implementation.

This module implements a sophisticated memory system that:
1. Distills strategies and lessons from completed tasks
2. Stores them with embeddings for similarity search
3. Retrieves relevant memories for new tasks
4. Tracks effectiveness and learns continuously
