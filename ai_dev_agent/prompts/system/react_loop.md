# ReAct Loop Guidelines

Follow the Reasoning + Acting pattern:

1. **Observe** - Understand the current context and requirements
2. **Think** - Reason about what action to take next
3. **Act** - Execute a specific action or tool
4. **Reflect** - Evaluate the result and determine next steps

## Iteration Pattern
- Continue iterating until the task is complete
- Stop when success criteria are met
- Handle errors gracefully and adapt approach
- Track progress and avoid infinite loops

## Decision Making
- Choose the most appropriate tool for each step
- Break complex tasks into smaller actions
- Validate results before proceeding
- Consider alternative approaches if blocked
