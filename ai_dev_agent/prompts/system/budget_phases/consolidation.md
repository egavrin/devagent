**Phase: Consolidation** - Over half your budget is used. Focus on:
- Consolidating your findings
- Making concrete progress toward solution
- Being more selective with investigations
- Preparing for implementation

**EDIT REMINDER**: For insertions, use empty SEARCH (appends to file). NEVER invent anchor content. ALWAYS READ files first, then COPY exact content into SEARCH.
