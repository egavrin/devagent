You MUST respond ONLY with valid JSON matching this exact schema:

```json
{format_schema}
```

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - no markdown, no explanations, no commentary
2. Match the schema exactly - all required fields must be present
3. Use proper JSON types (strings in quotes, numbers without quotes, booleans as true/false)
4. Do not add any fields not in the schema
5. END your response with the closing brace of the JSON object

Example valid response format:
```json
{{
  "field1": "value",
  "field2": 123,
  "field3": true
}}
```
